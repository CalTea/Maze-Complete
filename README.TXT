TITLE: Java, Maze Game
PURPOSE: This project was undertaken during college in order to strengthen my understanding of the Java programming language.

The programme was created with the BlueJ IDE. Make sure that upon cloning, that all files are compiled, then launch through the "Maze.java" file (main function).
